# Monte Carlo Solana Demo

**Monte‑Carlo Forecasts for the Top Solana Memecoin Wallets using Dune Analytics Top Traders Data**

## Overview

This project simulates wallet trading performance using Monte Carlo methods, based on real trading data from top Solana traders. The simulation models realistic trading behavior to forecast portfolio performance and calculate risk metrics for memecoin trading strategies.

## Features

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Probabilistic modeling of trading outcomes based on historical data
- **Real Trading Data**: Uses Dune Analytics data from top Solana memecoin traders
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates Sharpe Ratios and other risk-adjusted returns
- **Portfolio Forecasting**: Projects portfolio value starting from $10,000 over 30-day periods
- **Realistic Modeling**: Incorporates win rates, bucketed profit outcomes, and loss distributions
- **Daily Compounding**: Simulates day-by-day return compounding for accurate projections

## Key Metrics Analyzed

- **Sharpe Ratios**: Risk-adjusted return measurements for individual wallets
- **Win Rates**: Historical success rates of trading strategies
- **Profit/Loss Distributions**: Statistical modeling of trading outcomes
- **Portfolio Value Forecasts**: Projected returns over specified time periods

## Methodology

The simulation works by:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering trading data from top Solana memecoin wallets via Dune Analytics
2. **Statistical Modeling**: Analyzing win rates, profit buckets, and loss patterns
3. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Running thousands of simulated trading scenarios
4. **Compounding Returns**: Modeling day-by-day portfolio growth over 30-day periods
5. **Risk Analysis**: Calculating Sharpe ratios and other performance metrics

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tarto-bianco/Monte-Carlo-Solana-Demo.git
cd Monte-Carlo-Solana-Demo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
# Basic usage example
from monte_carlo_simulator import SolanaPortfolioSimulator

# Initialize simulator with trading data
simulator = SolanaPortfolioSimulator()

# Run Monte Carlo simulation
results = simulator.run_simulation(
    initial_capital=10000,
    days=30,
    simulations=10000
)

# Analyze results
print(f"Expected Return: {results.expected_return:.2%}")
print(f"Sharpe Ratio: {results.sharpe_ratio:.2f}")
print(f"95% Confidence Interval: [{results.ci_lower:.2f}, {results.ci_upper:.2f}]")
```

## Data Sources

- **Dune Analytics**: Top Solana memecoin trader performance data

# Monte Carlo Solana Demo

This project simulates wallet trading performance using Monte Carlo methods, based on real trading data from Solana traders.  
It models win rates, bucketed profit outcomes, and loss distributions to estimate:
- Sharpe Ratios of individual wallets
- Portfolio value forecasts starting from $10,000

All simulations are built to reflect realistic trading behavior, compounding returns day by day over 30 days.
